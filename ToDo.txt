Known Bugs:
-----------
1. Banks, websites, and countries searches are slow
3. Bitcoin Addresses aren't all bitcoin addresses
4. Index out of bounds error in ExtractData.ripWords() when dealing with large data
5. Clean up money dictionary. If input comes in as $3,000,457.23dsfsfd...strip it to be $3000457.23. Right now if money comes in with values 
   other than "$", digits, or "." it will screw up the program because its trying to convert that to a float in Output.descendingKey
7. Parentheses are not being removed on some words () {} [] <> "" ''
8. If just an @ or $ is found remove it from dictionaries
9. Money values have random strings attatched to the end of the number (_x000D_)
10. When alphabetizing emails by domain name...it works but emails that are all caps are treated seperately from noncap emails
11. Output.descendingKey() and Output.descendingValue seem to be part of the problem with the searches being slow. Look into.

Features to Add:
----------------
1. Toggle feature to turn off frequency values in summary data output
2. Sort money dictionary by key in descending order. (Output.descendingKey())
4. Add the ability to browse for file with browse button
5. Loading bar while program is processing
6. Desktop icon
7. Ability to search a name and show all of the sars related to it 
8. Better User Interface
9. Add country adjectives to search list.
